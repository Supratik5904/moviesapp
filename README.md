MoviesApp
MoviesApp is a project showcasing core concepts of asynchronous JavaScript and DOM APIs. Developed entirely in JavaScript and CSS, this application mimics IMDb by presenting a curated list of movies and TV shows. Instead of real-time data, it utilizes JSON-server to mock API responses.

How to Run the Application:
Start JSON Server:

Launch the JSON server by running the following command:

json-server --watch db.json --port 8080
This step initializes the server and sets it to watch the db.json file.

Open in Browser:

After starting the JSON server, open index.html in any web browser.
Features:
Asynchronous JavaScript: Utilizes async/await and fetch to handle API requests seamlessly.
Dynamic Content: Manipulates the DOM to display movie and TV show lists dynamically.
CSS Styling: Designed with modern CSS techniques to ensure an engaging user interface.
This project serves as an educational resource for understanding how to integrate front-end JavaScript with mock server data, providing a practical example of building a movie application similar to IMDb.
